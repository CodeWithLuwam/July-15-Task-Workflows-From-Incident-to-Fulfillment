## Overview
In ServiceNow, a typical request workflow moves through **three layers**:

sc_request â†’ sc_req_item â†’ sc_task


- **Request (`sc_request`)**: Represents the entire order.
- **Requested Item (`sc_req_item`)**: Represents individual items in the order.
- **Task (`sc_task`)**: Represents actions required to fulfill each item.

## âœ… Step 1: Access Your Request
1. Navigate to **All > Self Service > My Requests**.
